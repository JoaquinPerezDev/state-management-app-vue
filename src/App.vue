<script setup>
  import Parent from './components/Parent.vue'
  import { ref } from 'vue';

  const numbers = ref([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9])

  //NOTE ON PROP DRILLING: Prop drilling is the idea of passing down props from the 
  //top-most level(Parent) through every level including the nested component we need 
  //the props for(Great grandchild). We can accomplish this by declaring the ref in each
  //level then including :numbers="numbers" within the component tag of the child component.
  //In the case of our App, you can see below the Parent component is given access to the 
  //numbers, which then opens the possibility for the Parent's child components to receive 
  //the numbers as props as well. The big flaw to this approach is the repeatable nature. 
  //If the props were to be modified in the App view, we would need to modify them at every
  //level as well. There are better ways to accomplish giving access to nested components 
  //without the need to repeat and duplicate.
